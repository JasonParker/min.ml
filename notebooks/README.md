# Notebooks
This folder is for Jupyter notebooks associated with the relevant exploratory data analysis for the project.

Notice how the `notebooks` directory lives outside the `src` code directory; that's because the miniML design pattern is highly opinionated about the idea that **notebooks are for ad hoc exploration and analysis, never production code**.

This section was inspired by [Cookiecutter for Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#why-use-this-project-structure), which also suggests a naming convention for the notebook files stored here: "Naming convention is a number (for ordering), the creator's initials, and a short `-` delimited description, e.g. `1.0-jqp-initial-data-exploration`".
